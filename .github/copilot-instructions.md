This is a React TypeScript library project for a CAPTCHA component. The library provides:

- A React CAPTCHA component adapted from React Native
- TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- Modern build system using Vite
- Support for npm publishing

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Ensure components are accessible and responsive
- Use modern CSS (CSS modules or styled-components preferred)
- Write comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include proper error handling and user feedback
- Test components thoroughly before publishing

## Component Structure

- Main library code should be in `src/lib/`
- Export all public APIs from `src/lib/index.ts`
- Demo/example code in `src/demo/`
- Tests should be co-located with components
